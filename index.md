## Currently

Senior Software Scientist at Diamond Light Source

### Personal Statement

I'm a scientific software developer with a background in materials science research, so I am a curious problem-solver who enjoys understanding the fundamentals of challenges. I am a strong communicator and excel at translating between technical domain-specific languages. I've managed junior researchers and graduate software engineers; led high-profile projects; I've advocated for my group within the wider company, and represented the facility internationally.  

### Technical Skills

Python, Git(hub/lab), Jira/Confluence, Linux, C++, slurm, UGE, bash, neovim, SQL; Windows & Office. 

### Research interests

Total scattering theory, pair distribution function, synchrotron experimetnal design including using liquids, gases, electric fields, extremes of pressure and temperature.
