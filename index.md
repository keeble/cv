### Personal Statement

I'm a scientific software developer with a background in research, so I am a curious problem-solver who enjoys understanding the fundamentals of challenges. I am a strong communicator and excel at translating between technical domain-specific languages. I've managed junior researchers and graduate software engineers; led high-profile projects; and been an advocate for my group within the wider company.
